# ENSF 338 - Practical Data Structures and Algorithms
## Winter 2023

### My Data Structures Library

I've created a comprehensive library of data structures and algorithms in Java, inspired by the provided project outline. Here's a summary of what I've accomplished:

### Project Overview

**Objective:**
The goal of this project was to build a library for common data structures, including various linear data structures, tree structures, and graph algorithms.

**Languages Used:**
I've implemented this project using Java, but the structure and concepts are applicable to Python as well.

### Completed Tasks

In the course of this project, I've successfully designed and implemented the following components:

#### Data Structures
- **Linear Structures:** I've created implementations for various linear data structures, such as Singly Linked Lists (SLL), Doubly Linked Lists (DLL), Circular Linked Lists (CSLL), Circular Doubly Linked Lists (CDLL), Stacks, and Queues.

- **Tree Structures:** I've implemented Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

- **Heaps:** I've developed vector-based heap classes for both max and min heaps. These classes include a "heapsort" function to sort arrays efficiently.

- **Nodes:** I've designed and implemented various node classes that are essential for the proper functioning of the data structures mentioned above.

#### Graph Algorithms
- I've created a static class with static methods in the "Graphalgo" folder. These methods include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Testing:**
To ensure the functionality and correctness of these data structures, I've written unit tests using JUnit, which are located in the "test" subfolder of my project.

**Project Finalization:**
I've built the project using Maven to generate a "myLibrary.jar" file. This compiled library can be imported into any project for the convenient use of these data structure implementations.

### Conclusion

This project has been an exciting journey in data structure implementation and algorithm development. I've learned valuable skills in Java programming and software design, and I'm proud to present my very own data structures library.
